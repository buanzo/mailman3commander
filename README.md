# Mailman3 Commander

m3c is a simple console tool which helps you manage your Mailman3 setup. The tool is self-explanatoryâ€”just run `m3c`.

## Installation

Once published to PyPI you will be able to install the package with:

```bash
pip install mailman3commander
```

### Local setup

Until then you can run the project from source:


1. Clone the repository and move into it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buanzo/mailman3commander.git
   cd mailman3commander
   ```

2. Install the package in editable mode (this will install dependencies automatically):

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Invoke the console script:

   ```bash
   m3c
   ```

### Build

To build a distribution package locally, install the build tool and run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build
```
