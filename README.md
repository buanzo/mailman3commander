# Mailman3 Commander

m3c is a simple console tool which helps you manage your Mailman3 setup. The tool is self-explanatory, just run m3c.

# Installation

Just run:

    pip3 install midnight3commander

And you are done. (well, no, not really, we still need to release on pypi, so you will have
to git clone the repo, pip3 install -r requirements.txt, then switch to src/mailman3commander
and python3 mailman3commander.py)
