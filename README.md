# Mailman3 Commander

m3c is a simple console tool which helps you manage your Mailman3 setup. The tool is self-explanatoryâ€”just run `m3c`.

## Installation

Once published to PyPI you will be able to install the package with:

```bash
pip install mailman3commander
```

### Local setup

Until then you can run the project from source:


1. Clone the repository and move into it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buanzo/mailman3commander.git
   cd mailman3commander
   ```

2. Install the package in editable mode (this will install dependencies automatically):

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Invoke the console script:

```bash
m3c
```

## Docker helper functions

Some administrative tasks are easier to perform through the classic Mailman
CLI.  The module :mod:`mailman3commander.docker_mailman` provides thin wrappers
around ``docker compose exec -T mailman-core`` so these commands can be
invoked from Python:

```python
from mailman3commander import list_lists, list_members, add_members

stdout, stderr, rc = list_lists()
print(stdout)
```

The helpers expose ``list_members`` and ``add_members`` as well, all returning a
``(stdout, stderr, returncode)`` tuple for further processing.

## Reconnecting after ``setup.sh``

When the ``setup.sh`` script that bootstraps the Mailman stack exits the
services remain running in the background.  Use the script in
``examples/manager_reconnect.sh`` to reattach and launch the commander menu:

```bash
./examples/manager_reconnect.sh
```

### Build

To build a distribution package locally, install the build tool and run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build
```
